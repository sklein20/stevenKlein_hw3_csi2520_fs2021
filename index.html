                Hello, I am from Eastpointe, MI which is located in Macomb county. I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Information 
                Technology from Oakland University. My class standing is Senior, but I will not be graduating this year. I recently 
                changed my major from Computer Science, so I have more classes to take in order to graduate. As you will see below, 
                the progress bar shows the amount of credits I have earned so far. I have earned a lot of credits, but I am not as 
                close to graduating as I would like to be. As of right now, I do not have any professional affiliation with a company 
                with respect to web development or IT. I currently work as a Front End Assistant at Costco Wholesale. The jobs I have 
                held in the past did not really relate to IT or anything similar. I was thinking about becoming a system administrator. 
                I planned on starting as a help desk consultant and then working my way up. If you are interested in knowing more about 
                me, please check out the 
                <a href="html/my_resume.html">My Resume</a></li> and <a href="html/my_fun_facts.html">Fun Facts About Me</a> pages.
